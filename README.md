# i3-dotfiles
My dotfiles config for i3wm on ubuntu <br />
I've wrote some special scripts:
- polybar/scripts/redshift.sh.
- polybar/scripts/ibus_man.sh: switch ibus input method between xkb:us::eng and Bamboo (for vietnamese typing).
- i3/applets/touchpad.sh: disable synaptics touchpad when mouse is plugged and enable when mouse is unplugged.
